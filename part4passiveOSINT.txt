*Note: please stay ethical :)

Five Phases of Hacking:
	01 - Reconnaissance (*Passive vs Active)
		-typically Information gathering 
		-passive: when do info gathering doesn't involve client or entity itself
		-active: considerd as level-2 or scanning phase
	02 - Scanning and Enumeration (*Nmap, Nessus, Nikto, etc.)
		-the more enumeration you do the better of you are
		-Hacking is all enumeration
	03 - Gaining Access
		-find the way through social engineering or etc.
	04 - Maintaining Access
		-
	05 - Covering Track
		-auto cover your tracks (removing logs for example)
