Q&A / AMA

*Note: please stay ethical :)

Five Phases of Hacking:
	01 - Reconnaissance (*Passive vs Active)
		-typically Information gathering 
		-passive: when do info gathering doesn't involve client or entity itself
		-active: considerd as level-2 or scanning phase
	02 - Scanning and Enumeration (*Nmap, Nessus, Nikto, etc.)
		-the more enumeration you do the better of you are
		-Hacking is all enumeration
	03 - Gaining Access
		-find the way through some sort of explict, social engineering, etc.
	04 - Maintaining Access
		-
	05 - Covering Track
		-auto cover your tracks (removing logs for example)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Passive Recon - Physical / Social:
	- Location Information:
		- Satellite images
		- Drone recon
		- Building layout (badge readers, break areas, security, etc)
	- Job Information:
		- Employees (name, job title, phone number, etc)
		- Pictures (badge photos, desk photos, computer photos, etc)
Passive Recon - Web / Host:
	- Target Validation: 'whois' 'nslookup' 'dnsrecon'
	- Finding Subdomains: Google Fu, dig, Nmap, Sublist3r, Bluto, crt.sh, etc.
	- Fingerprinting: Nmap, Wappalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith, Netcat
	- Data Breaches: HaveIBeenPwned and similar lists
